odin-recipes - A recipes website project

This project will be a basic website for displaying recipes. The website will consist of an index page which links to a few other pages that contain the recipes.

The skills I will demonstrate in this site will be:

 - Build the HTML boilerplate template
 - Using headline, paragraphs, strong, emphasis, anchor and image tags.
